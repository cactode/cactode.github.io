The "useless machine" is a classic DIY project. It's a box with a single switch. When you press the switch, the box extends an arm and turns it off. It is truly a masterful representation of existential ennui in the 21st century. Or something like that. Whatever. Let's make an excessive version of it.

I made cute cube with a close friend of mine; she wanted to learn more about DIY, so I agreed to show her the ropes. I took charge of the mechanical side and she tackled the software.

The finished project doesn't look like much, but the mysterious HDMI port and usb cord are a little suspicious. This video should reveal why.

What's all the extra stuff inside it? Unlike the standard useless machine, this little box has:
1. A Raspberry Pi
2. A 32x32 RGB LED screen
3. Two drive motors
4. An accelerometer/gyroscope
5. A capacitive touch sensor (wired to the switch)
6. A 5W speaker system
7. A Li-ion battery with a BMS and charger
8. ...and a powerful digital servo to drive the arm.

Cute cube was planned out and built in three days. This required a bushel of compromises. Solidworks has a rather infamous feature that allows you to base geometry off of projected geometry. These models rarely last long before breaking. I drank an energy drink and made the entire model out of projected geometry in a couple of hours. I dearly hope that I never have to interact with it again.

Keeping with the strategy of "get it done", I 3D printed the entire housing. It took 30 hours to print. I'm sure that <i>any other</i> manufacturing method would have taken less time and been more sane... but hey, it wasn't my 30 hours.

Stuffing all of this hardware into a teeny box was a challenge. It took a little "encouragement", but it all fit under the lid. After programming was finished, the cube was ready.

Truly, a cute cube.
