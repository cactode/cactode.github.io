There's this great scene in Toy Story 1 where a giant claw machine picks up Buzz lightyear.

There's also this great scene in real-life where a real-life giant claw machine annoys people in my dorm's lounge.

Meet skycrane, a 10ft by 10ft 3-axis cartesian motion platform made out of $10 of parts. I built this in a weekend as a joke project for HackMIT (a hackathon). The idea was to have a giant room-sized claw machine that could be controlled by strangers on the internet. A small camera streams footage of the crane to Twitch; commands inputted into Twitch move the crane.

The rails of the system are just off-the-shelf EMT conduit; the linear slides are made out of repurposed chinese fidget spinner bearings. A Core-XY style capstan drive gets the whole thing moving in a robust fashion - even crashing the machine doesn't come close to killing it.

The electronics are duct-taped to a piece of cardboard. I have nothing to be proud of here.

There is one thing to be proud of, though. Remember how I said that this was a joke hackathon project? Well, it somehow _won_ a prize put out by QVC. The prize? An all-expense paid trip to see the QVC headquarters. So there's one thing that this machine has in common with the Toy Story claw - it led to a pretty alien experience.
