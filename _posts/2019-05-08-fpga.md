I can't say that I had the honor of making that acronym - that goes to Prof. Slocum - but I did have the honor of actually designing them.

FPGAs are bi-weekly assignments in [2.70](http://web.mit.edu/2.70/) that involve building a contraption of our choice. The only restraint is that we we demonstrate some fundamental principle of engineering - and, of course, that we do the math.

## FPGA 1: Finicky Preload with Great Applications
Have you ever counter-rotated two nuts to make a locknut? That question was rhetorical - everyone does that. But is it actually effective?

![](/img/projects/fpga/1.jpg)

Our first FPGA was an attempt to quantify the actual strength of these preloaded "locknuts". We first created an analytical model of two nuts held together.

<details><summary>(click to see code)</summary>
<p>
<pre><code>
%% FPGA 1

%% parameters
E = 200 * 10^9; %steel 200 GPa
l = 1/20 * 0.0254; %lead = 1/20 in
L = 7/32*2 * 0.0254; %length of assemble (m)
u = 0.5; % coefficient of friction
r = 1/8 * 0.0254; %radius of bolt

%% derived parameters
A = (((7/16)/2)^2 *pi - ((1/4)/2)^2 *pi) * 0.0254^2; % m^2 front area of nut

%% Do calculation
f1 = @computeForce;
f2 = @computeTorque;

%% Function
% Put in equations form
function force = computeForce(original, final)
    A = (((7/16)/2)^2 *pi - ((1/4)/2)^2 *pi) * 0.0254^2; % m^2 front area of nut
    strain = ((final - original)/original)/2;
    E = 190 * 10^9;
    stress = strain*E;
    force = stress * A;
end
function torque = computeTorque(preload)
    u = 0.5;
    r = 1/8 * 0.0254;
    torque = preload*sind(75)*u*r;
end
</code></pre>
</p>
</details>

We then put our tester-gadget into an Instron to see how our predictions lined up with reality. When using spring washers, our predictions were suprisingly accurate (within 22% in the worst trial) - but when directly mashing the nuts together, our model broke down. Our quest to fix this led to us realizing that bolt tensioning is a science within itself!

## FPGA 2: Figure Pondering Grading of Assignment
Our second FPGA was an attempt to make a bistable switch - but not just any switch. We wanted it to be the _most satisfying switch in existence_. 

![](/img/projects/fpga/3.jpg)

Our bistable switch features a special 2D arrangement of springs that allows it to snap between two positions with hysterises in a predictable fashion. The static behavior of the system was calculated using a potential energy well based solver.

This gave us a nice idea of how the switch would move over its range of motion. The final test showed that our model had only 16% error - most of which came from errors in measuring the resting length of our springs.

## FPGA 3: Flexures Put in Ghastly Applications
Flexures are wonderful, but they're not always easy to make. Their very nature means that they tend to move around as you machine them. Most people solve this by simply...not machining them. But what if you did?

![](/img/projects/fpga/5.jpg)

For this FPGA, we tried to quantify how bad tolerances would be if you tried to machine a pocket in a folded-stage flexure. A lot of tuning was needed to get the damn thing to cut in the first place. A lot of punishment was taken every time we messed up :c

![](/img/projects/fpga/6.jpg)

Our final model predicted our tolerances to be off by 0.08mm - and our final measurements confirmed this to be accurate (although our measurement techniques could surely be improved). 

![](/img/projects/fpga/7.jpg)

## FPGA 4: Freaky Pulleys Going Axially
Overhead cranes typically use large steel I-beams upon which steel rollers glide. Why not make it more like a zipline? Well, that would just result in the rope sagging. Why not use rope sagging to your advantage?

![](/img/projects/fpga/8.jpg)

The basic concept was to have two nonlinear winches synchronized together by gears. When one winch releases rope, the other winch takes up rope at the exact rate needed to keep a hanging object moving along a straight line. Tricky, but possible.

A giant pile of python code and math was used to generate a parametric path through space that represented the shape of the winch.

The final pulley system - despite all of our expectations - somehow worked as expected! Only a few nonlinearities were observed (mostly due to improper assembly).

![](/img/projects/fpga/10.jpg)

## FPGA 5: Figure Pulling Great mAss
When hit, a tetherball initially starts wrapping around the poll slowly but speeds up as it winds inwards. This is due to a decreasing moment of inertia and conserved energy. What would a flywheel built to mimick this look like?

![](/img/projects/fpga/11.png)

A small arm with two counterbalanced weights spins on a pivot. The spinning of the arm causes the two weights to be simultaneously winched together. Predicting how the speed would change as a result was suprisingly difficult and required my partner to write a custom Euler-Lagrange simulator.

Once it was built, we used Tracker to see whether our observations matched up with our predictions. Parasitic frictional losses ended up thwarting our model... but it was still cool to watch!
