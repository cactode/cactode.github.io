Sometimes, the name of the project preceeds the project. I thought of the name "Libertarian Vape Castle" before I realized it would be the name of my battlebot. Such is the genesis of thoughts inside the mind of an idiot.

The goal of this robot was to see how effective a unibody CNC'd frame would be on a battlebot. Most frames seem to break at the joints, so removing joints should theoretically make for a stronger battlebot. The second, hidden goal was to see how "lazily" a CNC'd robot could be made. There are only two unique CNC'd parts on this robot due to symmetry, and each one only needs ops from two sides.

I started this project two days before MassD as a divertion from endless schoolwork, so the "laziness" aspect was definitely necessary.

The weapon pulley, being the only manually turned part, ended up taking most of my time.

The frame rails are carved out of a wee block of billet.

The main hull is carved out of a not-so-wee block of billet that was waterjet out of 3/4" plate.

A 3D printed liner sits inside the final milled billet and protects all of the guts.

The final robot bolts together with 32 screws in total. While it's a pain in the ass to assemble, it at least ensures that stripped screws won't decommision the robot.

The final robot sounds like a broken dental drill and causes just as much damage.
