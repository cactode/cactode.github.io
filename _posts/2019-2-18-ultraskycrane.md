This.

Now _this_ is the dumbest thing I've ever made.

This is a building-sized (60ft by 20ft) cartesian motion platform that... sprays whipped cream on people.

A couple of friends and I built this for MakeMIT, a hardware hackathon held at MIT. Since this was my last year participating as a student, I decided to try the most ridiculous idea I could think of. I had previously built an [oversized crane](/2018-11-01-skycrane) for a different hackathon, but I wanted something more. I wanted _bigger_. Specifically, I wanted something as large as the hacking space was.

But how do you make linear rails long enough for something like this? Stiffness falls with the cube of length, so any unsupported rail for this would have to be prohibitively thick. The answer: rope.

Specifically, climbing rope under 200lb of tension. The idea is based off of the principle of [tensegrity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensegrity); by putting the ropes under high tension, they can be turned into extremely stiff rails upon which a gantry/carriage can run.
