![](/img/aboutme/me.png){: .center-image }

I grew up in San Diego and spent my college years at MIT. I love the sun and freeze whenever the temperature drops below 65 degrees.

I love making things that haven't existed before. Or things that have existed before. Either is fine.

I love building complicated things in simple ways. I love making simple projects complicated by trying to make them too simple.

I love learning new skills and testing them out on projects. I aim to be "The Jack of All Trades and Master of None". I am also pursuing a Masters. No, the irony is not lost on me.

I don't love finding novel ways of injuring myself, but that seems to be part of the deal.
