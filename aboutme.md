![](/img/aboutme/me.png =250x)
I grew up in San Diego and spent my college years at MIT. I love the sun and freeze whenever the temperature drops below 65 degrees.

I love making things that haven't existed before. Or things that have existed before. Either is fine.

I love building complicated things in simple ways. I love making simple projects complicated by trying to make them too simple.

I love learning new skills and testing them out on projects. I aim to be "The Jack of All Trades and Master of None". Unless you're a potential employer. Then you can ignore that last bit. I'm definitely the master of everything.

I don't love finding novel ways of injuring myself, but that seems to be part of the deal.
