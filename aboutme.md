![To be clear - I am the dog, not the person.](/img/aboutme/me.png){: .center-image }

I grew up in San Diego and spent my college years at MIT. I'm currently finishing up my Masters with a concentration in AI. 

I love making things that haven't existed before. Or things that have existed before. Either is fine.

I love building complicated things in simple ways. I love making simple projects complicated by trying to make them simple.

I love learning new skills and testing them out on projects. Anything is possible with enough time / stackoverflowing / WD-40.

I don't love finding novel ways of injuring myself, but that seems to be part of the deal.
